				<h2>Seminars and Posters Presented</h2>
					<p><strong>Poster presented at the 4th annual summer symposium </strong><em>July 2017, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Hyderabad, India</em>The poster depicted the utility of MongoDB for the creation BIG databases, as it was applied to the 134Kilo Molecules dataset.</p>

					<p><strong>Seminar Presented on Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms used in the realm of Cancer Research </strong><em>August 2015, Department of Biological Sciences, BITS Pilani Hyderabad, India</em>In the seminar techniques such as SVM, Kernel methods and Regression Curve Analysis were discussed along with their application in the detection of Breast Cancer.</p>

					<p><strong>Model Presented at the National Science Children's Congress 2010 </strong><em> Focal Theme: Environment Conservation, Hyderabad, India </em>This was conducted by the Government of India. A tool was designed to detect the level of soil compaction in any area. Various schemes to reduce soil compaction were presented, and its prevention strategies were discussed. The project was selected for the State Level round.</p>

					
				<h2>Research Experience</h2>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li><strong>June 2018-Present, Research Intern <em>Machine Teaching Group,</em> Max Planck Institute of Software Systems.</strong></li><br>
					<li><strong>May-July 2017, VSRP (Visiting Student Research Program) Fellow <em>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Hyderabad, India</em> Database Systems project</strong><br>Developed a database/data-mining platform and a RESTful API for 134Kilo molecular dataset using NodeJS and MONGODB. The web application enabled property  based querying and charting of the dataset.</li><br>
					<li><strong>June-August 2016, VSRP (Visiting Student Research Program) Fellow <em>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Hyderabad, India</em> Machine Learning project</strong><br>Studied sparse supervised learning algorithms: LASSO, ridge regression, SVM, Random Forest for application to classifying dipole-dipolarophile organic reactions. Also, mechanisms to improve the performance of LASSO were implemented using optimization techniques such as SUBPLEX, coordinate descent algorithms and Ridge Regression in order to reduce the bias of LASSO for better predictive accuracy.</li><br>
