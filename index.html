	<p class="lead">I am currently a Doctoral Student, in the <a href="https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html">Machine Teaching Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute for Software Systems</a>.</p>
	<p>We are working towards building AI-based assistive systems to aid students in problem-solving. We model our problem using Sequential Decision Making and (Inverse) Reinforcement Learning methods.
