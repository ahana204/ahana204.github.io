	<p class="lead">I am currently a 4th Year Doctoral Student, in the <a href="https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html">Machine Teaching Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute for Software Systems</a>. 
		I am advised by Dr. Adish Singla. I am also a student in the Microsoft Research EMEA PhD Scholarship Program (2019).</p>
	<p>I am working towards building AI-based assistive systems to aid students in problem-solving with special focus on Computer Science education (<a href="https://www.blockstopython.com/">https://www.blockstopython.com/</a>). Our problems are modelled using techniques from program synthesis, sequential decision making and reinforcment learning.
</p>
		<p>I am currently also leading BITSAA International's Pulse team, overseeing a YouTube-based podcast initiative affiliated with <a href="https://www.bitsaa.org/">BITSAA</a>, the alumni association of BITS Pilani. I spend my downtime reading historical fiction and philosophy. I enjoy travelling and exploring new places. <a href="https://prussianblu.wordpress.com/author/prussianblu/">Here </a>is the link to my literary blog. I also co-created a mini-interview series on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BITSnBYTESshow">BITS n Bytes</a> where we got candid with luminaries from diverse domains of technology, arts, politics and the sciences in India.</p>
