<h2>Projects Completed</h2>
				<p><strong>January 2018 - April 2018, Web based interface for Autism School, SMILES.</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Developed a website for an Autism School to store, calculate, and maintain the medical history of autistic children at the SMILES Foundation, Hyderabad, India.</li>
				<li>The website was built using NodeJS and for the database MongoDB was used.</li>
				</ul>
				
				
        <p><strong>November 2017, April 2018, Binary Sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes Classifier, Multi-class Logistic Regression with Parameter Optimization (using JAVA), BITS Pilani Hyderabad, India.</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Code for Logistic Regression and 2-Layer Neural Networks can be found <a herf="https://github.com/ahana204">here.</a></li>
				<li>A binary sentiment analyzer was developed in JAVA using modifications of the Naive Bayes classifier and a multi-class logistic regression algorithm was implemented with grid search to deal with any generic dataset.</li>
				</ul>


        <p><strong>September 2017, Implemented Random Forest, ID3 with pruning in JAVA, Project done as part of the machine learning course at BITS Pilani Hyderabad, India.</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>The model works for any categorical data-set. The execution time of the model is comparable to the CARET Package of R.</li>
				</ul>

        <p><strong>August 2017-December 2017, Fractal Theory, Design Project, BITS Pilani Hyderabad, India, Guide: Prof.Sharan Gopal.</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Completed a study/design project on Fractal Theory in order to understand the properties of fractals and visualize them using programming tools.</li>
				<li>I am also exploring the applications of fractal dimensions for fast feature selection.</li>
				</ul>


        <p><strong>March 2017, Student Healthcare Database using MongoDB, Project done as part of the Database Systems course, BITS Pilani Hyderabad, India.</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>A student health care database was created for the students on campus using MongoDB.</li>
				<li> The front end was a website, created using NodeJS. Students could update their health records, and query relevant information such as, 'Contact Details of students with a certain Blood Group' through the website.</li>
				</ul>

        <p><strong>November 2015, Program to Find the Shortest Path to various places within college, Project done as part of the Graph Theory course, BITS Pilani Hyderabad, India.</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>The C++ program was based on 'Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm', with weighted edges.</li>
        <li>The weights for the edges were generated keeping in mind the 'Sun-Index', a measure of the intensity of sun light on the path.</li>
        </ul>
